# TODO(developer): Rewrite with your protocol definition.

# This is the protocol for the dummy miner and validator.
# It is a simple request-response protocol where the validator sends a request
# to the miner, and the miner responds with a dummy response.

# ---- miner ----
# Example usage:
#   def dummy( synapse: Dummy ) -> Dummy:
#       synapse.dummy_output = synapse.dummy_input + 1
#       return synapse
#   axon = bt.axon().attach( dummy ).serve(netuid=...).start()

# ---- validator ---
# Example usage:
#   dendrite = bt.dendrite()
#   dummy_output = dendrite.query( Dummy( dummy_input = 1 ) )
#   assert dummy_output == 2
